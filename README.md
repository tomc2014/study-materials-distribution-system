# study-materials-distribution-system
System that can allow instructors to distribute study materials to his/her students and be able to announce tests and assignments e.t.c.

I am a third year student at the University of Dodoma, college of Informatics and Virtual Education pursueing bachelor of science in software engineering. In our college there is a problem of study materials and notes distribution. This is normally done by flash drives and announcements about tests and assignments are done locally which leaves students in a confusion state.

I want to develop a web application that will enable a student to login and have access to his/her course materials when an instructor uploads those course materials and be able to read the test and assignments announcements and due date. Therefore an instructor should also be able to login and uploads the materials and be able to announce the tests and assignments. The web app should also display the time left for a certain test to be attempted and the time left for a certain assignment to be submitted.

And so much more...
